## I.	Contemporary AI and mind games

The definition of Artificial intelligence, most known as AI, dates from 1956 on the leafy campus of Dartmouth College, where artificial intelligence was essentially described as machines that can simulate human’s learning or other features of intelligence (Vella, 2017).  Within decades of years, AI has been developed so fast that Russell and Norvig (2010) point out once super AI accomplished, it would change lives of humankind. They further emphasize ethical consequence that those super machines at a certain level might “threaten human autonomy, freedom, and even survival” (p. 1051) (Russell & Norvig, 2010).

Meanwhile, there has been live evidence of this statement right now, which is alpha Go developed by Google DeepMind group. With swift deep learning ability, this AI has made the threat into reality and shocked the whole world, by defeating two most representative and legendary players, Go world champion Ke and chess world champion Kasparov (Going places; artificial intelligence, 2017). 

So far, those games like chess and Go have been officially defined as mind games by the 1st World Mind Sports Games, which comprised competitions for five games: bridge, chess, draughts, Go and xiangqi (Chinese chess) (World Bridge Games Makes an Impressive Debut, 2008). Unlike AI, minds games have been fruits of human wisdom for thousands of years, but now they may be the most AI-impacted professional field of sports. When reviewing the defeat, Kasparov and Greengard (2017) believe after thousands of years of human dominance, the game is over now and machines will be better than humans at chess forever. 
	
Fortunately, we still have relaxing voice stating that unlike the steady growing rate of computer power, AI development would come to a real bottleneck after the present intensive growth according to the archive research (Atkinson, 2017). Paul-Choudhury believes that due to lacking knowledge of how our mind works, AI may stay at this level in the near future (as cited in Atkinson, 2017, p. s4126).

It might be true that the human players of mind games would be supressed by AI from now on, but analysis and evidence are supporting more proofs that at least in the short term, human players should not be afraid of AI. After answering questions about the implement motivation, community recognition and psychological impacts, we could reason out that human will still be the core part of mind games and would become better with the help of AI.

## II.	What would AI bring to mind game players, Apocalypse or Genesis??

1. 	Would super AI be created as professionals?

In 1949, scientists predict that once invented, computers would take over jobs from man (Atkinson, 2017). The predictions turned out to be true on some jobs like house temperature controller and automatic plane pilots (Atkinson, 2017). Now after the narrow 1-match win made by Deep Blue on chess 20 years ago, AI has made defeating human players not challenging, with a 3-0 clean win to Ke (Going places; artificial intelligence, 2017). The reason why AI is progressing so fast is that human cannot practice continuously likewise, 24 hours everyday without rest (Atkinson, 2017). As computers did replace those eliminated jobs decades of years ago, with faster growth rate, would contemporary AI did it to human players soon？ 

However, even if capable in a longer future, at least now the most potential AI player is not created for replacements of players or competing for championship against human. DeepMind, the development group of AlphaGo, verifies that this machine will assist to biological brains but not replace them in the end, by helping people to find out new solutions of problems (Going places; artificial intelligence, 2017). 

Besides, according to the bottleneck of AI development mentioned in section 1, AI may stay at this level in a certain long period. Therefore, we should not worry about the replacing crisis of human players in the near future, since contemporary AI at research level does not aim at competing for championship with human on their own will or under someone’s command. 

2.	 Can humanoid AI be recognized as mind game players by people?

There is a huge difference between the early concerns of machines replacing people’s jobs and the fear of AI hitting the labor pool today, that AI is capable of completing jobs requiring creativity, imagination and intuition, instead of jobs that are only repetive and uncreative ones (Atkinson, 2017). As evidence, AlphaGo plays and learns in a very human way, but it showed some creative moves beyond the existing wisdom (Atkinson, 2017). Since AI has been thinking similarly to human beings and with more creativity, is it possible to be more admirable than human players?

Firstly, though thinking more humanly, AI has not shown all mental tools that human beings are born with (Showdown; Artificial intelligence and Go, 2016). That means machines like AlphaGo do not have more aims and more awareness of their existence than a word processing or accounting applications (Showdown; Artificial intelligence and Go, 2016). Kasparov and Greengard (2017) also point out, human is more than just creativity, and we also have dreams and goals AI can not have. 

Secondly, people only have moral connection comfortably with identified beings similar to us (Frias, 2016). Agar considers that the identity mainly relies on whether it has typical performances of human beings, and despite of the appearance huge enhancement will weaken it too (as cited in Frias, 2016, p. 104). Obviously, AI is more powerful than human on mind games now, and neither AlphaGo nor Deep Blue has typical physical structure and mental tools as human, so we can not build more connection with AI than a drug-enhanced runner. All of those will certainly make contemporary AI impossible to be recognized equally as human players and engaged in mind games.

3.	Can AI spoil mental situations of mind game players?

When Kasparov and Greengard (2017) review the defeat 20 years ago, the chess champion says he did have sleepless night and felt annoyed by the mismoves. Even for the top professional players, it looks like very hard to come through the sense of loss after being defeated by an unemotional and inhuman enemy.

Nevertheless, after the mood of a moment, the former world champion still holds fearless attitude for the future with technology, and he believes all the downsides are just growing pains, because the new generation can use technology to fulfill our goals (Kasparov & Greengard, 2017) . 

Since Kasparov witnessed and joined the milestone event of AI rising, the confidence of the world champion could be a convincing start. Right now, we are more than glad to see after the loss to AlphaGo, Mr. Ke, the representative player of new generation, studied the moves of AI and found out new ideas (Going places; artificial intelligence, 2017). He went on 22 straight wins against human opponents, which is an impressive feat even for the top 1 player in the world (Going places; artificial intelligence, 2017). It proves that top human players will not be frustrated, but instead they are encouraged positively to face new challenge by AI, and try to exceed the existing wisdom as hard as possible (Going places; artificial intelligence, 2017)

## III.	Mind games players with AI in the future

According to the analysis above, we can conclude that there is no recent evidence showing that AI like AlphaGo would be transformed into professional players. Besides, people would not recognize and admire AI equally as human players of mind games, since inhuman AI does not have same structure and mental specialties as human. 

Plus, professional players may feel lost just because they hate loss, but with the appearance of AI they will not quit with only one loss (Kasparov & Greengard, 2017). With the enlightenment of AI, player is aspired to learn new things and that is how we human beings survived and exceeded machines uniquely through Industrial Revolution and beyond all those species on the earth.
