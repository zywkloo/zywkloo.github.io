## The Challenge: Upgrading SDKs with Breaking Changes

Picture this: You're working on a C# desktop application that interfaces with hardware through a C++ SDK wrapper. The SDK is stuck at version 1.0.6, but you need to upgrade to 1.2.2 to support new hardware features. The upgrade involves breaking changes across headers, wrapper classes, and API signatures. Sound familiar?

This is the reality of working with mixed C#/C++ projects where SDK upgrades aren't just about bumping version numbers‚Äîthey require:
- Analyzing SDK documentation against your existing codebase
- Mapping deprecated functions to new implementations
- Modifying header files, wrapper classes, and managed code simultaneously
- Maintaining consistency across .h, .cpp, and .cs files
- Dealing with stale code patterns and technical debt

Traditional approaches involve painstaking manual comparison, cross-referencing documentation, and hoping you catch all the breaking changes. But there's a better way: **vibe coding**.

## What is Vibe Coding?

Vibe coding is a mindset and workflow philosophy that leverages AI assistants to transform challenging SDK upgrades and legacy code maintenance into smooth, efficient experiences. It's about maintaining flow, maximizing productivity, and using modern tools strategically to tackle complex scenarios that would otherwise drain your energy.

When upgrading a stale SDK (like from 1.0.6 to 1.2.2) in a C#/C++ mixed project, vibe coding means:
- Using AI to read and analyze entire SDK documentation sets
- Generating comprehensive modification plans across multiple files
- Maintaining context consistency across .h, .cpp, and .cs modifications
- Leveraging multiple AI tools to handle different aspects of the upgrade
- Staying productive and focused despite the complexity

## The Real-World Scenario: SDK Upgrade Challenges

### Challenge 1: Documentation Analysis at Scale

When upgrading from SDK 1.0.6 to 1.2.2, you're not just dealing with incremental changes. Breaking changes might include:
- Renamed functions and classes
- Changed parameter signatures
- Deprecated APIs that need replacement
- New dependencies and initialization requirements
- Modified error handling patterns

**Without AI:** Days spent cross-referencing documentation, comparing header files, and manually tracking changes.

**With Vibe Coding:** Upload the SDK documentation and headers to Claude Code, ask it to analyze breaking changes, and generate a migration plan.

### Challenge 2: Multi-File Consistency

C++ SDK wrappers typically involve:
- C++ header files (.h) with native SDK bindings
- C++ implementation files (.cpp) with wrapper logic
- C# managed wrapper classes (.cs) exposing functionality to .NET
- Interop definitions and marshalling code

A single SDK function change might require modifications across all these layers.

**The Problem:** Different context strategies across AI tools can cause inconsistent modifications. A change in Cursor might be incompatible with changes made in Claude Code.

**The Solution:** Use the same AI model for the entire modification chain. Don't switch tools mid-upgrade.

### Challenge 3: Maintaining Context Across Long Sessions

SDK upgrades are marathon sessions, not sprints. You need to:
- Keep track of all modifications across hundreds of files
- Maintain awareness of cross-file dependencies
- Ensure that previous changes aren't inadvertently reversed
- Document modifications for future reference

**Traditional approach:** Losing context, forgetting dependencies, and introducing regressions.

**Vibe coding approach:** Use Claude Code + Sonnet for large context windows and stable continuity throughout the entire upgrade process.

## Cursor vs. Claude Code: Choosing the Right Tool

## Recommended Strategy for SDK Upgrades

### Phase 1: Analysis (Claude Code + Sonnet)

**Activity:** Deep dive into SDK documentation
1. Upload SDK headers from both versions (1.0.6 and 1.2.2)
2. Ask Claude to identify all breaking changes
3. Generate a comprehensive migration plan
4. Map deprecated functions to new implementations

**Why Claude Code:** Large context window can process entire SDK documentation sets and maintain consistency.

### Phase 2: Bulk Modifications (Claude Code + Sonnet)

**Activity:** Execute planned modifications
1. Batch modify header files (.h) based on SDK changes
2. Update wrapper implementations (.cpp) consistently
3. Adjust C# managed wrappers (.cs) in parallel
4. Ensure all layers stay synchronized

**Why Claude Code:** Cross-file modification capabilities ensure consistency across .h, .cpp, and .cs files.

### Phase 3: Fine-Tuning (Cursor)

**Activity:** Quick fixes and iterations
1. Fix compilation errors discovered during testing
2. Adjust interop signatures
3. Fine-tune C# wrapper methods
4. Iterate on error handling

**Why Cursor:** Fast, local editing for quick adjustments without losing momentum.

### Critical Rule: Consistency Within Modification Chains

**Don't switch AI tools mid-upgrade.** Use the same model for the same modification chain. Different context strategies can cause previous modifications to be overturned by subsequent ones.

**Example Workflow:**
- Start SDK upgrade planning with Claude Code + Sonnet
- Continue all bulk modifications with Claude Code + Sonnet
- Only switch to Cursor for quick fixes and fine-tuning
- Don't alternate between Cursor and Claude Code for the same set of files
