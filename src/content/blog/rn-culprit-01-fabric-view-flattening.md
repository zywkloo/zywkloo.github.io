## The Crime Scene

The app crashes every single time the user manually disconnects a BLE device. The stack trace offers no mercy:

```
*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException',
reason: 'RCTComponentViewRegistry: Attempt to recycle a mounted view.'

#11  -[RCTComponentViewRegistry _enqueueComponentViewWithComponentHandle:...]
       at RCTComponentViewRegistry.mm:114
#12  -[RCTComponentViewRegistry enqueueComponentViewWithComponentHandle:...]
       at RCTComponentViewRegistry.mm:69
#13  RCTPerformMountInstructions
       at RCTMountingManager.mm:67
```

Nothing in the trace points to our code. Every frame is deep inside React Native Fabric's mounting machinery. This is the classic shape of a Fabric internal crash — and it is always deterministic. 100% reproducible. Not a race condition. A structural bug.

## What Fabric Mount Instructions Are

Fabric's rendering pipeline reconciles the JavaScript shadow tree into a list of typed instructions that the main thread executes sequentially:

| Instruction | What it does |
|---|---|
| `Create` | Allocate a new native view |
| `Insert` | Mount it into a parent, call `addSubview` |
| `Remove` | Call `removeFromSuperview` on the parent |
| `Delete` | Recycle it back to the pool |
| `Update` | Push new props / layout metrics |

The invariant that must hold: **Remove always precedes Delete for the same view.** The assertion at `RCTComponentViewRegistry.mm:114` enforces exactly this:

```objc
RCTAssert(
    componentViewDescriptor.view.superview == nil,
    @"RCTComponentViewRegistry: Attempt to recycle a mounted view."
);
```

When `Delete` fires for a view whose `superview` is still non-nil, it means `Remove` either never ran or ran against the wrong parent. The crash is not a timing issue — the instruction list for a single commit is executed atomically on the main thread. The ordering is wrong before it even starts executing.

---

## The Backstory: Why There Were Two Views in the First Place

Before diving into the bug, it helps to understand why the problematic component structure existed at all.

The original header code used a ternary to swap between two native components in the same slot:

```jsx
// old code — the ternary pattern
{offlineSyncStatus?.kind === 'downloading'
  ? <ActivityIndicator color="#FFFFFF" size="small" />
  : <SearchIcon color="#FFFFFF" size={24} />}
```

When the download state changes, Fabric must `Delete` the `ActivityIndicator` and `Create` + `Insert` the `SearchIcon` (or vice versa). Two different native component types alternating in the same slot under rapid state updates — that is also a known Fabric trigger for "Attempt to recycle a mounted view."

The fix was correct in principle: **stop conditionally mounting and unmounting native components in the same slot.** Instead, keep both always mounted and toggle visibility via opacity:

```jsx
// new approach — always mounted, opacity toggle
<View style={[styles.searchIconLayer, isDownloading && styles.transparent]}
      collapsable={false}>        {/* ← this is what we'll get to */}
  <SearchIcon color="#FFFFFF" size={24} />
</View>

<OfflineDownloadIndicator visible={isDownloading} />
```

This eliminates the `Delete` / `Create` cycle entirely. The always-mount approach is the right call. But it introduced a new crash for a different reason.

---

## The New Culprit: View Flattening

React Native Fabric applies an optimization called **view flattening** (also called view preallocation or collapsing). When a `View` has no visual properties — no `backgroundColor`, no `borderWidth`, no `opacity` set in style — Fabric marks it as *collapsable* and skips allocating a native `UIView` for it entirely. Its children are promoted and inserted directly into the grandparent's native view.

Both new wrapper views fit this profile exactly:

```jsx
// searchIconLayer: position absolute, no visual properties
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  searchIconLayer: {
    position: 'absolute',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    // no background, no border, no shadow → collapsable
  },
  offlineDownloadIndicator: {
    position: 'absolute',
    height: 48,
    width: 124,
    // still no visual properties → collapsable
  },
});
```

After flattening, the two trees diverge:

```
Shadow Tree (Fabric's virtual world)
  Animated.View
    └── searchIconLayer          ← shadow node exists, NO native view
          └── SearchIcon (SVG)

UIKit native hierarchy (the real world)
  Animated.View
    └── SearchIcon (SVG)         ← promoted one level up
```

Fabric's reconciler computes `Remove` instructions using shadow tree parent-child relationships. When a layout commit arrives (BLE disconnect causes a state update that changes the header layout), Fabric generates:

```
Remove SearchIcon from searchIconLayer
Delete  SearchIcon
```

`searchIconLayer` has no native view. The `unmountChildComponentView` call targeting it is a no-op. `SearchIcon` is still physically attached to `Animated.View`. Then `Delete` fires — `view.superview != nil` — assertion fails — crash.

---

## The Fix

Force a native view for every absolute-positioned layout wrapper. `collapsable={false}` prevents Fabric from eliminating the view, keeping the shadow tree and UIKit hierarchy structurally identical:

```jsx
// OfflineDownloadIndicator root
<View
  style={[styles.offlineDownloadIndicator, !visible && styles.transparent]}
  pointerEvents="none"
  accessibilityElementsHidden={!visible}
  importantForAccessibility={visible ? 'auto' : 'no-hide-descendants'}
  collapsable={false}>   {/* ← forces a real UIView */}
  ...
</View>

// searchIconLayer in GlobalHeader
<View
  style={[styles.searchIconLayer, isDownloading && styles.transparent]}
  pointerEvents="none"
  collapsable={false}>   {/* ← same fix */}
  <SearchIcon color="#FFFFFF" size={24} />
</View>
```

With `collapsable={false}`, the shadow tree matches UIKit exactly:

```
Shadow Tree == UIKit hierarchy
  Animated.View
    ├── searchIconLayer (native UIView backed)
    │     └── SearchIcon
    └── OfflineDownloadIndicator (native UIView backed)
          ├── ActivityIndicator
          └── View > Text, Text
```

`Remove` now targets the correct parent. `removeFromSuperview` succeeds. `Delete` sees `superview == nil`. No crash.

---

## The Principle

> **Any `position: 'absolute'` View that serves as a layout-only wrapper — no background, no border, no shadow — inside a component that receives layout commits should carry `collapsable={false}`.**

The cost is one extra `UIView` allocation. The benefit is a crash-proof parent-child mapping in Fabric's mount instruction list.

A broader rule for working with Fabric's rendering layer:

**① Do not swap different native component types in the same slot under rapid state changes.** Use always-mounted components with opacity/style toggling instead. Conditional rendering that alternates between `ActivityIndicator` and `SearchIcon` is exactly the pattern that makes Fabric generate conflicting Delete/Create instruction pairs.

**② Any layout-only wrapper View that is `position: 'absolute'` and visually transparent needs `collapsable={false}`.** Fabric's view flattening is silent — there are no warnings, no diagnostics, no "this view was flattened" log. You discover it when the mount instruction references a phantom parent.

**③ Be extra careful inside `Animated.View` with `useNativeDriver: true`.** The native driver manages its subtree on a separate thread. Absolute-positioned children that Fabric collapses break the strict shadow-to-native mapping that the native driver depends on.

**④ View flattening is a Fabric-specific behavior, not an old-arch concept.** Code patterns that worked safely in the old bridge architecture can produce deterministic crashes in Fabric with no migration warning.

## Other Fabric Culprits (to be covered in this series)

This crash is one of a family of Fabric gotchas that share the same root: the shadow tree and the native UIKit hierarchy silently diverge. Here are others on the list:

- **Ternary conditional between different native component types** — the root cause this fix was addressing; deserves its own breakdown of the instruction conflict
- **`setNativeProps` is silently broken in New Arch** — it bypasses the shadow tree entirely; Fabric's next commit overwrites your manual change with no warning
- **`display: 'none'` parent with children that receive prop updates** — in some RN versions, child update instructions are still generated for `display: none` subtrees, which can conflict with layout-pass optimizations
- **`KeyboardAvoidingView` behavior differences** — Fabric's layout timing is synchronous where old arch was async; this changes when `onLayout` fires relative to keyboard events, breaking assumptions baked into KAV implementations
- **`Modal` + Fabric surface isolation** — Modals render on a separate Fabric surface; refs, accessibility focus, and state you pass through portals can silently lose their native backing
- **`ScrollView` `onScroll` throttling** — the event pipeline changed; throttle values that felt smooth in old arch now skip frames or fire too aggressively in Fabric depending on the native driver configuration

Each of these follows the same investigative pattern: a crash or visual glitch that the stack trace blames on RN internals, with the actual bug hiding in a component pattern that was safe in old arch but breaks a Fabric invariant.
